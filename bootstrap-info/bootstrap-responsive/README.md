# CSS Layout Lab

## Timings

45 - 60 minutes

## Summary

The starter code contains HTML and some CSS from Steve's profile you've been working on. Your task is to change the layout of the page so the content doesn't just follow down the page, but is positioned alongside, above and below. Make it as simple and appealing as you can - otherwise all design decisions are up to you. Here is an example of what you could come up with:

### Index Page
![index]

### Projects Page
![projects]

To complete this task you should make use of the following features of HTML and CSS: 

 - HTML classes and ids
 - The CSS display property
 - Percentage and pixel values
 - CSS Floats and Clears
 - Margins and paddings

**HINTS:**

1. You may need to change the order of the HTML to achieve a desired change in CSS
2. Avoid using margins or absolute/fixed positions to keep things in place - this is the fastest possible way to unreadable, unfixable code!
3. Just focus on the browser at full width for now.

## Bonus Tasks

 1. Look up CSS flexbox and see how you could use it for the layout of your page
 2. Try and reduce your CSS to as few lines as possible
